## Ubuntu 18.04.1 Desktop (192.168.226.180)
This desktop consists of all the vulnerabilities found and mentioned in this report. 

####           DNS Zone Transfer
| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Low                | Low                 | Low          | Low         |  

##### Recommendation

Restrict AXFR requests to IP addresses that are from trusted sources only. DNS could be given to a third party who would register for you and thus protect from information disclosure

#### SMTP Enumeration

| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Low                | Low                 | Low          | Low         |

##### Recommendation

Configure SMTP server to neglect emails to unknown receivers.  Disable open relay.

####           FTP Anonymous Login
| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Low                | Low                 | Low          | Low         |

##### Recommendation
Disable anonymous login under the Anonymous FTP Controls.

#### Poor Programming Skills and Documentation

| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Low                | Low                 | Medium       | Medium      |
  

##### Recommendation

Follow proper programming and documentation guidelines. Do not include any sensitive information in the source code or notes.

#### Insecure Storage of Secret Files
 | Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Medium             | Low                 | Medium       | Medium      |

##### Recommendation

Always ensure that files with crucial information are stored securely either in a secrets management system or hidden with least privilege access defined towards that particular file.
#### Command Injection

| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Medium             | Medium              | Low          | Medium      |

##### Recommendation

Remove the admin_config.html page. Could also code the page to escape malicious input or only allow a specific set of commands

#### SQL Injection
| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Low                | Medium              | Medium       | Medium      |

##### Recommendation

Better coding practices when implementing connections to databases such as the use of prepared statements

#### OSINT
| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Medium             | Low                 | Medium       | Medium      |

##### Recommendation

Use of strong passwords for the social media accounts that cannot be gained access to via a bruteforce or dictionary attack

Ensuring no disclosure of confidential information publicly or through channels that are not trusted

#### Weak Password Policies

| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Medium             | Medium              | High         | High        |

##### Recommendation

Strong passwords that do not use or minimize use of words from dictionaries in patterns. Long complex passwords, making the user reset their passwords after a set period of time, disabling reuse of passwords

#### SSH Abilities by Bruteforcing

| Threat Level Score | Vulnerability Score | Impact Score | Risk Rating |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| High               | Medium              | High         | High        |

##### Recommendation

Randomizing passwords and managing these passwords with a password manager. Password length and complexity policies must be applied. Reuse of passwords must not be permitted
